CS 338 - Smart Meetings Slack

## Slack Client Actions
The Slack client from the Slack SDK let's us perform static operations in our workspace,
i.e. get channel's history at that point in time, send a message, etc.

## Event Subscriptions
Using the Slack Bolt features we can listen to realtime events in our app, such as messages sent,
messages received, app home screen opened, etc. https://slack.dev/bolt-python/tutorial/getting-started

To do this, add an event subscription here https://api.slack.com/apps/A01LT5D4T7E/event-subscriptions?,
(add bot user event) then add the respective listener (in docs above) into app.py, run the script, and test in Slack.

Note: the Request URL at the above link is where ngrok routes incoming requests from Slack,
running ./ngrok http 3000 again will change that URL and we will have to change it in Slack.
